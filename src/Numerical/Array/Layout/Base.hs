{-
NB: may need to add some specialization for low rank indexing,
theres 4 choices:
a) INLINE EVERYTHING
b) rewrite rules that take low rank indexing code into specialized versions thereof
c) wait till ghc 7.8.2 to resolve https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/8848
    and use SPECIALIZE
d) benchmark and then decide

for now I choose (a), and defer benchmarking variations till everything works :)


a related concern is the interplay of inlining and specialization

    One important invariant about all layouts at all ranks is that for
    any given ints x < y, that the array index for inr

     toIndex shapedLayout (pure x :: Shape rank Int) is strictly less than
     toIndex shapedLayout (pure y :: Shape rank Int).

     more generally

     for rank k tuples,
      xi = x_1 :* ... :* x_k *: Nil  and
      yj = y_1 :* ... :* x_k *: Nil
      such that forall \ell, x_\ell  < y_\ell
    we have that
       toIndex shapedLayout xi <  toIndex  shapedLayout yj


this actually relates to the notion of partial ordering over vectors in convex
geometry!


so roughly: we have layouts that are dense
we have layouts that can be used as tiles (and are dense)

and we have layouts which can can't be tiled, but can have elements which are tiled

So we have

PrimitiveLayouts

Static Layouts

General Layouts (which are a Top level layout over a static layout)

the Layout class tries to abstract over all three cases
(NB: this only makes sense when the "rank" for the inner
and outer layouts have the same rank!)

-}


{- Sized is used as a sort of hack to make it easy to express
   the staticly sized layouts. NB, one trade off is that its only
   possible to express  "cube" shaped blocks, but on the other
   hand blocking sizes are expressible for every single rank!

be a breaking change i plan for later

{-
what is the law for the Layout class?
forall valid formms
toIndex sd  (fromIndex sd ix)==ix
fromIndex sd (toIndex sd shp)==shp
-}

{-
if   tup1 is strictly less than tup2 (pointwise),
  then any lawful Layout will asign tup1 an index strictly less than that
  asigned to tup2

  transposedLayout . transposedLayout == id



i treat coordinates as being in x:* y :* z :* Nil, which is Fortran style idexing

in row major we'd have for x:* y :* Nil that X is the inner dimension, and y the outter,
by contrast, in column major, y would be the inner most, and x the outter most.

{- In some respects, the Layout type class is a multidimensional
analogue of the Enum type class in Haskell Prelude,
for Dense / Dense Structured matrix formats
but
    a) requires a witness value, the "Form"
    b) needs to handle multivariate structures
    c) has to deal with structure matrices, like triangular, symmetric, etc
    e) I think every layout should have pure 0 be a valid index, at least for "Dense"
