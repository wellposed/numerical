{-
a general question that you might ask is "what primops need have a monad constraint"

ie rather than having type a -> b, why are they type Monad m => a -> m b ?

the answer boils down to the following: most array types have
a *PURE* header data structure that can't be mutated,
that contains the Shape, extent, some handle/pointer to the associated underlying
buffer/datastructure.  Any (even nominally pure) access to  that potentially
mutable buffer should be mediated by a monad.

I further assume that the *structure* and *extent* of this underlying buffer cannot change.

That is, A valid address will always stay valid, even if after some mutation it may
    correspond to a *different* index than it did before.

Fix ME, these names are lame

ImmArray == immutable array
